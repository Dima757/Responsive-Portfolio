                <div>
                    <p>I am a hard working and ambitious web developer. Some of my best qualites are creativity, precision,
                        and quality of content. I try to put my best foot forward on all projects and am highly competetive
                        when asked to do an assignment.

                        <br>
                        <br> During these next six months I will be asked to do several challenging tasks that might make me
                        want to give up and quit. However, I know that deep down insde there is no quit for me at this point
                        and I am ready to take everything that is given to me head on and I am sure I will survive and succeed.

                        <br>
                        <br> The hardest part of this whole assignment is getting off a good base and having the proper building
                        blocks on top of everything. One false move can mess up your whole page and make you have to go back
                        and do everything all over again. This is very scary to me but at the same time I understand how
                        important trail and error are in the learning process so therefore I am appecting of such trials
                        and tribulations ahead of me.</P>
